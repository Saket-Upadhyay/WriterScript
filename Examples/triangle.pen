Subhas Chandra Bose[pronunciation?] January – August [g] was an,
Indian nationalist whose defiant patriotism,
made him a hero in,
India[h][i][j] but whose attempt during,
World War II to rid,
India of British rule with the help,
of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a troubled legacy[k][l][m],
The honorific Netaji Hindustani: "Respected,
Leader" first applied in early,
to Bose in Germany by,
the Indian soldiers of the,
Indische Legion and by the,
German and Indian officials in,
the Special Bureau for India,
in Berlin was later used,
throughout India[n]Bose had been a leader of the younger,
radical wing of the Indian National,
Congress in the late s and s rising,
to become Congress President in and [o] However he,
was ousted from Congress leadership,
positions in following differences with,
Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress,
high command He was subsequently,
placed under house arrest by,
the British before escaping from,
India in Bose arrived in,
Germany in April where the,
leadership offered unexpected if sometimes ambivalent sympathy,
for the cause of India's independence contrasting starkly with,
its attitudes towards other colonised,
peoples and ethnic communities In,
November with German funds a,
Free India Centre was set,
up in Berlin and soon a Free India Radio on,
which Bose broadcast nightly A -strong,
Free India Legion comprising Indians captured by Erwin,
Rommel's Afrika Korps was also formed to aid in,
a possible future German land invasion of India By,
spring in light of Japanese,
victories in southeast Asia and,
changing German priorities a German invasion of India became,
untenable and Bose became keen to move to southeast,
Asia Adolf Hitler during his only meeting with Bose,
in late May suggested the,
same and offered to arrange for a submarine During,
this time Bose also became a father; his wife,
or companion[p] Emilie Schenkl whom he had met in,
gave birth to a baby,
girl in November Identifying strongly with the Axis powers and,
no longer apologetically Bose boarded a German submarine in February,
Off Madagascar he was transferred to a Japanese submarine from,
which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra in May With Japanese,
support Bose revamped the Indian National Army INA then composed,
of Indian soldiers of the British Indian army who had,
been captured in the Battle of Singapore To these after,
Bose's arrival were added enlisting Indian civilians in Malaya and,
Singapore The Japanese had come to support a number of,
puppet and provisional governments in the captured regions such as,
those in Burma the Philippines and Manchukuo,
Before long the Provisional Government of,
Free India presided by Bose was formed,
in the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar,
Islands[q] Bose had great drive and charisma—creating popular Indian,
slogans such as "Jai Hind"—and,
the INA under Bose was a model of diversity by,
region ethnicity religion and even gender However Bose,
was regarded by the Japanese as being militarily unskilled[r],
and his military effort was short-lived In,
late and early the British Indian,
Army first halted and then devastatingly reversed the Japanese attack,
on India Almost half the,
Japanese forces and fully half the participating INA contingent,
were killed[s] The INA was driven down the Malay,
Peninsula and surrendered with the recapture of Singapore Bose,
had earlier chosen not to surrender with his forces or with the,
Japanese but rather to escape to Manchuria with a view,
to seeking a future in the Soviet Union which he,
believed to be turning anti-British He died from,
third-degree burns received when his plane crashed in Taiwan[t],
Some Indians however did not believe that the crash,
had occurred[u] with many among them especially in Bengal,
believing that Bose would return to gain,
India's independence[v][w][x]The Indian National Congress the main,
instrument of Indian nationalism praised Bose's,
patriotism but distanced itself from his tactics and ideology[y],
especially his collaboration with fascism,
The British Raj though never,
seriously threatened by the INA[z],
charged INA officers with treason,
in the INA trials but,
eventually backtracked in the face,
both of popular sentiment and,
of its own endSubhas Chandra,
Bose was born on 23 January 1897,
(at 1210 pm) in Cuttack Orissa Division Bengal Province,
to Prabhavati Dutt Bose and,
Janakinath Bose an advocate belonging,
to a Kayastha family He,
was the ninth in a,
family of 14 children His family was well to doHe,
was admitted to the Protestant European,
School (presently Stewart High School) in Cuttack like,
his brothers and sisters in January 1902 He continued,
his studies at this school which was run by the Baptist Mission,
up to 1909 and then shifted to the Ravenshaw Collegiate,
School After securing the second position in the matriculation examination,
in 1913 he was admitted to the,
Presidency College where he studied briefly,
He was influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda,
and Ramakrishna after reading their,
works at the age of 16 He felt that his,
religion was more important than his studiesIn those,
days the British in Calcutta,
often made offensive remarks to the Indians in public,
places and insulted them openly This behavior,
of the British as well as,
the outbreak of World War I began to influence,
his thinkingHis nationalistic temperament came,
to light when he was,
expelled for assaulting Professor Oaten,
(who had manhandled some Indian,
students) for the latter's anti-India,
comments He was expelled although,
he appealed that he only,
witnessed the assault and did,
not actually participate in it,
He later joined the Scottish,
Church College at the University of Calcutta and passed his,
BA in 1918 in philosophy Bose left India for Europe,
on 15 September 1919 arriving,
in London on 20 October He had made a,
promise to his father to prepare and appear,
for the Indian Civil Services (ICS) examination for which,
his father has made available Rs 10000 In London Bose readied his,
application for the ICS staying in Belsize,
Park with his brother Satish who,
was preparing for the bar exam According to,
historian Leonard A Gordon: "Subhas' Civil Service application demonstrates,
his family’s connectedness to the small interrelated elite,
of Bengal For references he gave the names,
of the two highest-ranking Indians,
in the councils of the British-Indian establishment Lord Sinha of,
Raipur Under Secretary of State for India and the first,
Indian to serve as governor of a province under the,
Raj and Mr Bhupendranath Basu a wealthy,
Calcutta solicitor and a member of,
the Council of India in London"In 1938,
Bose stated his opinion that the,
INC "should be organised on the broadest anti-imperialist front,
with the two-fold objective of,
winning political freedom and the establishment of a socialist regime",
By 1938 Bose had become a leader of,
national stature and agreed to,
accept nomination as Congress President He stood for unqualified,
Swaraj (self-governance) including the use of force,
against the British This meant a,
confrontation with Mohandas Gandhi who in fact opposed Bose's presidency,
splitting the Indian National Congress,
party Bose president-elect INC arrives in Calcutta 24 January,
1938 after two-month vacation in AustriaBose attempted to maintain,
unity but Gandhi advised Bose to form his own,
cabinet The rift also divided Bose,
and Nehru Bose appeared at the 1939,
Congress meeting on a stretcher He,
was elected president again over Gandhi's preferred candidate Pattabhi,
Sitaramayya U Muthuramalingam Thevar strongly,
supported Bose in the intra-Congress dispute Thevar mobilised all south,
India votes for Bose However due to the,
manoeuvrings of the Gandhi-led clique,
in the Congress Working Committee,
Bose found himself forced to resign from the Congress,
presidency[citation needed]On 22 June 1939 Bose organised,
the All India Forward Bloc a,
faction within the Indian National Congress aimed at consolidating the,
political left but its main strength,
was in his home state Bengal U Muthuramalingam Thevar,
who was a staunch supporter of Bose from,
the beginning joined the Forward Bloc When Bose visited Madurai,
on 6 September Thevar organised a massive rally as his,
receptionWhen Subhas Chandra Bose was heading to Madurai on an,
invitation of Muthuramalinga Thevar to amass support for,
the Forward Bloc he passed through Madras and spent three,
days at Gandhi Peak His correspondence reveals that despite his,
clear dislike for British subjugation he was deeply impressed by,
their methodical and systematic approach and their steadfastly disciplinarian outlook,
towards life In England he exchanged ideas on,
the future of India with,
British Labour Party leaders and,
political thinkers like Lord Halifax,
George Lansbury Clement Attlee Arthur,
Greenwood Harold Laski JBS Haldane,
Ivor Jennings GDH Cole Gilbert,
