India (Hindi: Bhārat) officially the Republic of India (Hindi:,
Bhārat Gaṇarājya)[23] is a country,
in South Asia It is,
the second-most populous country the,
seventh-largest country by land area,
and the most populous democracy,
in the world Bounded by,
the Indian Ocean on the,
south the Arabian Sea on,
the southwest and the Bay,
of Bengal on the southeast it shares,
land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China Nepal and,
Bhutan to the north; and,
Bangladesh and Myanmar to the,
east In the Indian Ocean,
India is in the vicinity,
of Sri Lanka and the,
Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar,
Islands share a maritime border,
with Thailand and IndonesiaModern humans,
arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later,
than 55000 years ago[24] Their long,
occupation initially in varying forms of isolation as,
hunter-gatherers has made the region highly diverse second only to,
Africa in human genetic diversity[25] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in,
the western margins of the Indus river basin 9000,
years ago evolving gradually into,
the Indus Valley Civilisation of,
the third millennium BCE[26] By,
1200 BCE an archaic form,
of Sanskrit an Indo-European language,
had diffused into India from,
the northwest unfolding as the,
language of the Rigveda and recording the,
dawning of Hinduism in India[27] The Dravidian languages of India,
were supplanted in the northern,
and western regions[28] By 400,
BCE stratification and exclusion by,
caste had emerged within Hinduism[29],
and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen proclaiming social orders,
unlinked to heredity[30] Early political consolidations,
gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta,
Empires based in the Ganges Basin[31] Their collective era was,
suffused with wide-ranging creativity[32] but,
also marked by the declining status of women[33] and the incorporation of,
untouchability into an organised system,
of belief[g][34] In South India,
the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages,
scripts and religious cultures to,
the kingdoms of Southeast Asia[35]In,
the early medieval era Christianity,
Islam Judaism and Zoroastrianism put,
down roots on India's southern and western coasts[36] Muslim armies from Central,
Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains[37] eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate and,
drawing northern India into the,
cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam[38],
In the 15th century the,
Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India[39] In,
the Punjab Sikhism emerged rejecting institutionalised religion[40],
The Mughal Empire in 1526 ushered,
in two centuries of relative peace[41] leaving a,
legacy of luminous architecture[h][42] Gradually expanding rule of the,
British East India Company followed,
turning India into a colonial,
economy but also consolidating its,
sovereignty[43] British Crown rule began,
in 1858 The rights promised,
to Indians were granted slowly[44],
but technological changes were introduced,
and ideas of education modernity,
and the public life took root[45] A,
pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged which was noted for,
nonviolent resistance and became the,
major factor in ending British,
rule[46] In 1947 the British,
Indian Empire was partitioned into,
two independent dominions a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and,
a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan amid,
large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration[47][48]India,
has been a secular federal republic since 1950 governed in,
a democratic parliamentary system It is a pluralistic multilingual and multi-ethnic society,
India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to,
1211 million in 2011[49] During,
the same time its nominal,
per capita income increased from,
US$64 annually to US$1498 and,
its literacy rate from 166%,
to 74% From being a,
comparatively destitute country in 1951[50],
India has become a fast-growing,
major economy a hub for,
information technology services with an,
expanding middle class[51] It has,
a space programme which includes several planned,
or completed extraterrestrial missions Indian movies music and spiritual teachings,
play an increasing role in,
global culture[52] India has substantially,
reduced its rate of poverty,
though at the cost of,
increasing economic inequality[53] India is,
a nuclear weapons state which,
ranks high in military expenditure,
It has disputes over Kashmir,
with its neighbours Pakistan and China unresolved since the,
mid-20th century[54] Among the socio-economic challenges,
India faces are gender inequality child malnutrition[55] and,
rising levels of air pollution[56] India's land is megadiverse with,
four biodiversity hotspots[57] Its forest cover,
comprises 214% of its area[58] India's wildlife which has traditionally been viewed,
with tolerance in India's culture[59] is,
supported among these forests and elsewhere,
in protected habitats According to the,
Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009),
the name "India" is derived from,
the Classical Latin India a reference,
to South Asia and an uncertain,
region to its east; and in,
turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos,
( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush,
an eastern province of the,
Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its,
cognate the Sanskrit Sindhu or "river" specifically the Indus river and by,
implication its well-settled southern basin[60][61] The,
ancient Greeks referred to the Indians,
as Indoi (Ἰνδοί) which translates as,
"The people of the Indus"[62]The term,
Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] (About this,
soundlisten)) mentioned in both Indian epic,
poetry and the Constitution of India[63][64] is used in its variations by,
many Indian languages A modern rendering,
of the historical name Bharatavarsha which,
applied originally to a region of,
the Gangetic Valley[65][66] Bharat gained increased,
currency from the mid-19th century as,
a native name for India[63][67]Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn],
(About this soundlisten)) is a Middle,
Persian name for India introduced during,
the Mughal Empire and used widely since Its meaning has varied referring,
to a region encompassing present-day northern India,
and Pakistan or to India in,
its near entirety[63][67][68] By 55000 years ago the,
first modern humans or Homo sapiens had arrived on,
the Indian subcontinent from Africa,
where they had earlier evolved[69][70][71],
The earliest known modern human,
remains in South Asia date,
to about 30000 years ago[72],
After 6500 BCE evidence for,
domestication of food crops and,
animals construction of permanent structures,
and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in,
Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan[73] These,
gradually developed into the Indus,
Valley Civilisation[74][73] the first urban,
culture in South Asia[75] which,
flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in,
what is now Pakistan and western India[76] Centred around,
cities such as Mohenjo-daro Harappa Dholavira,
and Kalibangan and relying on varied forms of,
subsistence the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging,
trade[75]During the period 2000–500 BCE,
many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the,
Iron Age ones[77] The Vedas the oldest,
scriptures associated with Hinduism[78] were composed,
during this period[79] and historians have analysed these,
to posit a Vedic culture,
in the Punjab region and,
the upper Gangetic Plain[77] Most,
historians also consider this period,
to have encompassed several waves,
of Indo-Aryan migration into the,
subcontinent from the north-west[78] The,
caste system which created a,
hierarchy of priests warriors and,
free peasants but which excluded,
indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure arose during this period[80] On,
